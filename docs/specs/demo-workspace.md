# Spec: demo-workspace — public live-demo dashboard

Status: implemented 2026-07-09. Production and visual checks remain pending. Demo Sessions was
amended to finalized-only on 2026-07-17.

## Goal

The landing page records itself with the real SDK into a dedicated **demo project**. The landing "Live demo" buttons open the real dashboard at a public, read-only `/demo` route showing live sessions of real landing-page visitors — including the visitor's own session appearing live. This fills the slot ARCHITECTURE.md §6 already reserved: "a public read-only demo workspace covers try-before-signup instead."

## Non-goals

This historical demo task predates Better Auth. The current account system remains separate from the anonymous demo path. No changes to the ingest wire format, SessionRecorder DO, or player internals. No curated/pinned-session mode in v1 (documented fallback if defacement becomes a problem).

## Design

### Env (worker)

- `DEMO_PROJECT_ID?: string` — id of the demo project.
- `DEMO_WRITE_KEY?: string` — plaintext demo write key (write keys are public-by-design; this one is intentionally served to browsers).

Demo behavior is active only when **both** are set and non-empty. When absent, behavior is byte-for-byte today's (fails closed) — covered by tests.

### Public discovery endpoint

`GET /api/v1/demo`

- Demo enabled → `200 {"projectId": "...", "writeKey": "..."}`, `cache-control: public, max-age=60`.
- Demo disabled → generic 404 (same body shape as other unmatched routes).
- No auth. IP rate-limited via `DEMO_API_RATE_LIMITER`. Emits the standard route wide event.

This single endpoint serves both consumers: the landing snippet (key discovery, so no prod key is committed to the repo) and the dashboard `/demo` route (project-id discovery).

### Demo auth context (`apps/worker/src/api/handler.ts`)

In `checkAuth`: if the request has **no** `Authorization` header, demo is enabled, and the route's project param `=== DEMO_PROJECT_ID` → return a demo auth context `{ projects: Set([DEMO_PROJECT_ID]), demo: true }`. Any explicit `Authorization` header is rejected and must **never** fall back to the demo. Other private project requests continue through the normal Better Auth session and membership checks.

Route opt-in is **deny-by-default**: only routes explicitly marked demo-readable accept the demo context; every other route treats a demo context as unauthenticated (401). Use an explicit per-route flag/allowlist mechanism, not path-pattern matching.

Demo-readable routes:

| Route                                             | Notes                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /projects/:pid/sessions`                     | clamp `limit` to ≤ 50 when demo (shared constant, e.g. `DEMO_SESSIONS_LIST_MAX`) |
| `GET /projects/:pid/live`                         | presence list                                                                    |
| `GET /projects/:pid/sessions/:sid/manifest`       | already immutable-cached                                                         |
| `GET /projects/:pid/sessions/:sid/segments/:name` | already edge-cached                                                              |
| `POST /projects/:pid/sessions/:sid/live-ticket`   | ticket is already session-scoped, 60s TTL                                        |

NOT demo-readable (must 401 for a demo context): `GET/PUT /config`, `GET /keys` (returns write keys), `GET /install-status`, all `/__test/*` routes, and everything else. The live WS route keeps its short-lived ticket check.

### Rate limiting

New Workers rate-limiter binding `DEMO_API_RATE_LIMITER` (follow the existing `wrangler.jsonc` binding pattern and the existing missing-binding handling), keyed by `cf-connecting-ip`, 600 req / 60 s. Applied to every demo-context request and to `GET /api/v1/demo`.

### Logging

Per PLAN.md ground rules: exactly one wide event per unit of work via the `@orange-replay/shared` logger, emitted in `finally`; no `console.log`. The existing API event gains an auth-mode field (`authMode: "session" | "demo"` — align naming with existing event fields).

### Security invariants (each needs a test)

1. Demo disabled (env unset) → every previously-401 request is still 401; `/api/v1/demo` → 404.
2. A demo context cannot: read or write any other project; `PUT /config` on the demo project; `GET /keys`, `GET /config`, `GET /install-status` on the demo project; hit `/__test/*`.
3. Better Auth session behavior is unchanged; an explicit authorization-header credential on a demo-project route returns 401 instead of falling back to the demo.
4. Sessions-list `limit` is clamped for demo contexts.
5. No client-supplied header/param/body can enable demo for a non-demo project (server derives demo purely from env + project id).

Cost invariants untouched: no timers, no payload decompression, no DO/hibernation changes, no extra `setAlarm()` writes.

## Task A — worker + bootstrap

File budget: `apps/worker/src/api/handler.ts`, `apps/worker/src/index.ts`, `apps/worker/src/app-shell.ts` (serve the dashboard shell at `/demo` and `/demo/*`), the worker `Env` type declaration, `apps/worker/wrangler.jsonc` (dev + `env.production`: vars placeholders + `DEMO_API_RATE_LIMITER`), `apps/worker/.dev.vars.example` (local demo values), worker tests, `scripts/bootstrap-demo-project.mjs` (new), `packages/shared/src/constants.ts` (only if a shared constant is genuinely needed).

Bootstrap script: creates the demo org + project (`retention_days: 2`, `sample_rate: 1.0`, `allowed_origins` = the production landing origin per `docs/deployment.md`) + one write key. Follow `scripts/bootstrap-prod-project.mjs` conventions exactly: generated secrets go to the ignored local env file, never printed; print the wrangler commands the operator runs to set `DEMO_PROJECT_ID` / `DEMO_WRITE_KEY`. Header comment: this script touches production — review and test before running.

Tests: the security-invariant list above, `/api/v1/demo` response shape + caching + 404, limit clamp, app-shell served at `/demo`.

## Task B — dashboard demo mode

File budget: `apps/dashboard/src/**` and dashboard tests only.

- `/demo` route tree: fetch `/api/v1/demo` → `projectId`; reuse the existing sessions list, session detail (replay), and live components scoped to that project. 404/network failure → friendly "demo not available" state.
- `/demo/sessions` uses finalized `/sessions` rows only. It does not request or merge provisional `session-heads`; `/demo/live` remains the real-time surface.
- API client demo mode: derived from the route location (never persisted); requests omit `Authorization`; a 401 in demo mode shows an inline error state and never redirects to `/login`.
- Read-only UI: Settings + Install hidden from nav; persistent slim banner on all demo pages: "Live demo — real sessions from our landing page, read-only." with a primary CTA "Start free" → `/login`. Banner follows `docs/design-language.md` (dark `#0a0a0c`, amber accent, `.lit` treatment where appropriate); it will be judged by screenshot against `design-final.html`.
- Live tab and live session watching must work (ticket mint is demo-readable).
- Reuse existing components/ui primitives (Fluid Functionalism registry components already in the tree); do not hand-roll primitives or duplicate screens.

Tests: `/demo` bypasses the private account-session requirement; the API client sends no private account credential in demo mode; nav items are hidden; the demo-unavailable state renders.

## Task C — landing instrumentation

File budget: `landing/index.html` only. Keep edits surgical and avoid a wholesale reformat.

- Both "Live demo" anchors (currently `href="/login"`) → `/demo`.
- Recording snippet before `</body>`: a small inline async IIFE that fetches `/api/v1/demo` (same origin); on 200 it boots the genuine SDK loader (reproduce the real snippet shape from `packages/sdk/src/loader.ts` / the dashboard install page) with the returned `writeKey`, same-origin recorder bundle (`/or-recorder.js`) and ingest. Non-blocking; silently no-ops on 404, network error, or `file://` preview; the failure path must never throw or log.
- Add `data-orange-block` to any input/form elements on the page.
- Disclosure: one short line adjacent to the mid-page Live demo CTA: "This page records anonymized, masked sessions to power the live demo — your visit may show up there." Match surrounding typography; understated. (External-facing copy — gets human review before ship.)

## Verification

Run `vp check` and `vp test` from the repo root with `apps/worker/.dev.vars` temporarily moved aside. Then run the full Playwright suite, compare `/demo` and the landing page with `design-final.html`, and record the result in `HANDOFF.md`.
